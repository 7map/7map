## Installation

You'll need :

- a computer running Windows/Linux (macOS untested) 
- a [fresh jdk installation](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk16-downloads.html)
- maven (you can install the packages yourself but that's basically suicide because there's a high chance of you missing a couple of them)
- some patience (*optional*)

Anyways, once you're done gathering the aforementioned stuff, just clone the repository and run either **Demo.java** or **App.java**

If you did the things right, you should get something that looks approximately like the screenshots shown above.

## Usage

Please refer to the [user manual](doc/manuel-utilisateur.md).
